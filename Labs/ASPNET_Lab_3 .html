			<h2> Steve Jobs</h2>

			"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma â€“ 
			which is living with the results of other people's thinking."

			<h2> Douglas MacArthur </h2>
			<p style="font-family: oblique;"> Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old only by deserting their ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up interest wrinkles the soul. Worry, doubt, self-distrust, fear and despair;
				these are the long, long years that bow the head and turn the growing spirit back to dust. Whatever your years, there is in every being's heart the love of wonder, the undaunted challenge of events, the unfailing childlike appetite for what next,
				and the joy and the game of life </p>
